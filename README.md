# bb-plugin-gitlab

GitLab issues and merge requests inside BB, with one-click agent dispatch.
Self-managed instances are first-class: every host `glab` is logged into is a
host this plugin can reach.

```sh
bb plugin install git:https://github.com/suiramdev/bb-plugin-gitlab.git@main --yes
```

`@main` tracks the branch head. Pin a release instead to have
`bb plugin outdated` / `bb plugin update` follow compatible tags only:

```sh
bb plugin install 'git:https://github.com/suiramdev/bb-plugin-gitlab.git@^0.1.0' --yes
```

BB clones the ref, installs production dependencies, and builds
`dist/server.js` + `dist/app.js` itself, so nothing has to be committed built.
`glab` on `PATH` is the only prerequisite.

An id carries one source, so switching between them (git ↔ a local checkout for
development) starts with `bb plugin remove gitlab`; the plugin's cache and
thread links survive it.

## What it does

- **Sidebar panel** (GitLab tanuki, full width): Issues and Merge requests tabs
  across every tracked project, one filter box that takes qualifiers —
  `is:open`, `is:draft`, `assignee:@me`, `author:dana`, `label:"needs triage"`,
  `project:gitlab.com/acme/web`, `no:assignee`, `no:label` — plus plain text,
  completed from the loaded items and driven by the keyboard (↑/↓, Enter or Tab
  to accept, Escape to dismiss). The query persists in localStorage.
- **Issue detail**: markdown description, notes, comment box, state, assignee
  and label editing, plus "Send agent". Deep-linkable through the URL hash:
  `#/issues/<host>/<namespace/path>/<iid>`.
- **Merge-request detail**: source → target branch, mergeability, pipeline jobs,
  approvals, reviewers, conversation notes, inline discussion threads, and
  per-file diffs rendered by the same syntax-highlighting engine as the rest of
  BB, following the host's code theme. Deep-linkable as
  `#/merge_requests/<host>/<namespace/path>/<iid>`.
- **Send agent / Review with agent**: spawns a BB worker thread on the issue (or
  a review thread on the merge request) in the matching BB project. The item
  then shows a ⚡ pill linking to the thread.
- **Homepage section**: recent open issues with the same Send agent buttons.
- **Mentions**: `#` completes GitLab issues, `!` completes merge requests (`@`
  does both); the selected item's title, state, and description are attached as
  agent context at send time.
- **`bb gitlab` CLI**: `projects`, `issues [project]`, `mrs [project]`, `sync` —
  also discoverable by agents through the plugin-commands skill, alongside the
  bundled `gitlab` skill that teaches `glab` conventions, with GraphQL
  (`glab api graphql`) for what the subcommands do not cover.

## Auth and any GitLab domain

Uses the GitLab CLI on connected BB machines, so the plugin reaches the instances their `glab` installations reach —
`gitlab.com`, a self-managed instance on any domain, or several at once. Every
host that appears as `Logged in to <host> as <user>` in `glab auth status` is
usable. Credentials remain on the machine running glab. The list combines
results across machines by GitLab host, project, kind, and IID, retaining the
last successful results while a machine is unavailable.

The Machine selector controls live reads and changes. When more than one
machine can reach a host, choose a machine before changing data. A selected
offline or unauthenticated machine fails explicitly; writes never fall back to
another account. Agent threads use their BB project's default environment.

```sh
glab auth login --hostname gitlab.example.dev # on each relevant machine
bb plugin reload gitlab
```

A host's own glab config describes how it is reached, and the plugin reads that
config instead of guessing, so these all work:

| Hosting | glab config on that host | What the plugin does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Plain domain, any TLD | — | uses the hostname as-is |
| Served under a path, `https://example.com/gitlab/` | `subfolder: gitlab` | drops the subfolder from project paths |
| API on a non-default port | `api_host: example.com:8443` | maps the port-bearing remote back to the host |
| Git over SSH on another name | `ssh_host: ssh.example.com` | maps that remote to the same instance |
| Plain HTTP, private CA, mTLS, proxy | `api_protocol`, `ca_cert`, `client_cert`, `proxy` | nothing needed — glab applies them |
| Internationalized domain | — | normalized to punycode, matched case-insensitively |

Ports and schemes never appear in a project ref: `glab --hostname` takes a bare
hostname, and the ref keeps exactly the name glab knows. IPv6 literal hosts are
the one gap, because glab rejects them.

## Which projects are tracked

A project is addressed by its **host-qualified ref**:
`gitlab.example.dev/group/subgroup/app`. The host is the first segment; the rest
is the namespace path, which may have any number of segments.

- Every BB project whose git remote points at an authenticated GitLab host —
  including remotes that use that host's `ssh_host`, `api_host`, or subfolder
  form. That mapping is also how "Send agent" picks the BB project to spawn in.
  The remote comes from BB's own project record, so a checkout on an enrolled
  remote host resolves exactly like a local one. A remote on a GitLab host glab
  is not logged into is reported in `bb plugin logs gitlab`.
- Plus the `extraProjects` setting: a comma-separated list of refs, normalized
  for you — a scheme, mixed case, a port, a subfolder, or a trailing slash are
  all accepted, and a bare `group/app` uses `defaultHost`.
- `defaultProject`: where threads spawn for GitLab projects with no BB project.

```sh
bb plugin config gitlab set extraProjects "https://Code.Example.dev:8443/gitlab/group/app, other/app"
bb plugin config gitlab set defaultHost gitlab.example.dev
bb plugin reload gitlab
```

A background service refreshes the issue/MR cache every 5 minutes; the panel's
Refresh button (or `bb gitlab sync`) forces it. The cache holds open items plus
a page of recently closed and merged ones, and the panel filters that cache in
the browser, so `is:closed` or `is:merged` costs nothing. Detail views,
mutations, and mention resolution always go live. Every request the plugin
sends to GitLab is a GraphQL request through `glab api graphql`.

## Development

```sh
npm install --include=dev   # once
npm run typecheck
npm test
bb plugin build             # dist/server.js + dist/app.js + dist/app.css
bb plugin reload gitlab
```

`bb plugin dev` watches and reloads on every save. Plugin logs:
`bb plugin logs gitlab -f`.
